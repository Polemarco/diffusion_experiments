# TreeDiffusion.ipynb - Making a Video from Prompts with Stable Diffusion

_by John Robinson_

I created this notebook while taking Jeremy Howards's fantastic course, ["From Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion"](https://www.fast.ai/posts/part2-2022.html).

This notebook demonstrates using [StableDiffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) to generate a movie from nothing more than a seed image and a sequence of text prompts.

[@jeremyphoward](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) gives a great [explanation of how it works here.](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1583667503091548161)

Also, Thanks to [johnowhitaker](https://twitter.com/johnowhitaker) and his youtube channel, [DataScienceCastnet](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP6gT9X2oXYcssfZu05RV2g) for his great content on Stable Diffusion and ML.
